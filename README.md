AI-Powered Drive Simulation and Navigation Demo
Welcome to the AI-Powered Drive Simulation and Navigation Demo, a Python application that simulates driving from one location to another while providing real-time updates and suggestions based on traffic conditions. The application integrates Google Maps and OpenAI for enhanced navigation experience.

Features
Real-Time Route Simulation: Simulates driving with updates every few seconds, translating to real-world time.
Dynamic ETA Adjustments: Calculates and adjusts Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) based on traffic and user responses.
Conversational Assistance: Uses OpenAI to engage users and provide suggestions if they are running late.
Step-by-Step Directions: Offers detailed step-by-step directions for the route taken.
User Input: Allows users to set their origin, destination, and desired arrival time.
Technologies Used
Python
Google Maps API
OpenAI API
Logging for debugging
HTML/CSS for command-line output formatting
